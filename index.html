          Hello there, my name is José C. Medina, Jr. I am a tech savvy Tennis and Marketing Professional. 
          I have worked with numerous CMS (Content Management Systems) throughout the past 15 years. 
          I worked for the <b>USTA (United States Tennis Association) Florida Section</b> for many years as the <b>Web Site Coordinator</b> and provided IT support as well. 
          Throughout my tenure at the USTA I gained invaluable experience in the web publishing world. 
          More recently, I have been the <b>Web Editor</b> of <b><a href="http://MiamiOpen.com" target="_blank">MiamiOpen.com</a></b>
          for the Miami Open tennis tournament that is held yearly in March in the Miami area.
          I have been the editor for the <b>Miami Open</b> for the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 tournaments.
          It has been a thrill to work in tennis which is my passion, along with managing the day-to-day publishing needs of one of the biggest and most important tennis tournaments in the world.   
        </p>
  
        <p>
          I'm bilingual, having been born in the Andes Mountains city of <b>La Oroya, Perú</b>.  As you can imagine, I'm an avid tennis …and soccer fan. 
          Let's go <b><a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/" target="_blank">FC Barcelona</a></b>, or as they say in Cataluña - Visca El Barca. Having been around the tennis industry for a while, 
          I have met quite a few tennis playing professionals over the years. In fact, I'm an amateur sports action photographer, please visit my
          <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tennis_image/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></b> page to view my tennis images from different tournaments.  
        </p>

        <p>
          My motivation comes from my amazing family, my beautiful wife Lily, and our adorable daughter, Massiel.<br><br>
          
          <i>Last but not least, I decided to enroll in the University of Miami's Coding Boot Camp to gain deep knowledge of all the aspects of the web world.  I will become a Full Stack Web Developer by June 2020. 
            I can't wait to learn and learn and never stop learning about being a Web Developer.</i>
